## Feature requests
I'am open for new ideas on how to improve the project and expand its functionality. Especially, because this tool currently has a strong focus on electric vehicles and I want to provide some useful features for people with normal cars too. If there is anything you would like to track, feel free to open a feature request!  

## Contributing code
Pull requests are always welcomed! I dont have the time and ressources to implement every database type for example. If you write some interface, I'll gladly merge your code.

The same goes for improving the quality of the current code. Iam by no means a python expert just and started to hack some stuff together until it worked.
